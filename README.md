This repository contains all the project on Neural Networks, reports on experiences and interesting links.

- **Simple Neural Network :** A handcrafted 3 layer Network using biases, some evaluation and a report. 

## Simple Neural Network
A 3 layer Neural Network. The input consists of 8 elements, the hidden layer uses 3 nodes and the output is 8 elements as well.
Bias is added at the input and hidden layer, the sigmoid function is used for activation.

### How to run
1. Change to the proper directory `cd simple_neural_network`
2. Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run using `python3 main.py`

## Resources
The implementation is mostly based on the *Advanced Concepts in Machine Learning* slides by [Kurt Driessen](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kurt_Driessens)
